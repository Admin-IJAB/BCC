* # Description:
    Front-end web application that uses an HTML audio player and client-side javaScript to create a light-weight iTunes style app to play local mp3 files. This application is aimed to be a vanilla JS representation and proof-of-conecpt of how we as artists can break away from the grasp of today's social media bondage.

    Use this page to listen to songs from the IJAB catalog, including some hidden songs that inspire us. 

* ## Usage:
    1. Scroll through each section to click and choose which song to play next.

    2. Once you have chosen the song, press play in audio player to listen. Audio player also allows user to change song tempo, as well as download tracks they enjoy (bettah follow ðŸ”«).

    3. While song is playing you may click more songs to add to a "queue", and when you are ready to move onto the next song, you may click "next track" and it will load the next song into the player.
